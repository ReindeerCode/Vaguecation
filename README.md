## Description:

Problem: 

Covid has people couped up and ready for a vacation. For many people the planning process is the least enjoyable part of a vacation, so why not skip it??? Vaguecation will provide the user with a random location to visit without a lot of hoops to jump through.

With more development Vaguecation will be able to email users a randomly generated email package, complete with hotel, restaurant, and activity suggestions for each day the user is looking to get away.


## Installation Instructions:

To install, type `npm install` into the terminal. This will install all the required node packages to run the server. Start the application by typing `npm start` into the terminal. 

## Usage Instructions: 
To be emailed a Vaguecation location enter your email address and click any of the image buttons.
